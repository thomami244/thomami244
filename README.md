- 👋 Hi, I’m @thomami244
- 👀 In my first career I qualified as a top-flight chartered accountant. I worked around the world, including 8 years for investment banks, but decided I needed something more. So for my next career, I am studying computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a digital coaching/ innovation website. I am keen to use AI, data, three.js, but I feel like I am needing much more programming knowledge - which is why I am learning!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that revolve around how thoughts are constructed/ developing real communities/ creating innovative products and services.
